Cheminformatics Development Platform: OpenEye provides a large suite of cheminformatics 
toolkits to solve a wide variety of problems in molecule handling and representation.

1 Cheminformatics

The Cheminformatics suite of toolkits provides the core foundation upon which all of the
OpenEye applications and remaining toolkits are built. The Cheminformatics suite is a 
collection of seven individual yet interdependent toolkits that are described in the table below.

  Toolkit	Major Functionality
  ---------------------------------
  FastROCS TK	Real-time shape similarity for virtual screening, lead hopping & shape clustering
  OEChem TK	Core chemistry handling and representation as well as molecule file I/O
  OEDepict TK	2D Molecule rendering and depiction
  Graphemeâ„¢ TK	Advanced molecule rendering and report generation
  GraphSim TK	2D molecular similarity (e.g. fingerprints) 
  Lexichem TK 	name-to-structure, structure-to-name, foreign language translation 
  MolProp TK	Molecular property calculation and filtering 
  Quacpac TK	Tautomer enumeration and charge assignment
  MedChem TK	Matched molecular pair analysis, fragmentation utilities, and molecular complexity metrics

2 Modeling

The Modeling suite of toolkits provides the core functionality underlying OpenEye's defining
principle that shape & electrostatics are the two fundamental descriptors determining intermolecular 
interactions. Many of the toolkits in the Modeling suite are directly associated with specific OpenEye 
applications and can therefore be used to create new or extend existing functionality associated with 
those applications.

  Toolkit	Major Functionality
  ---------------------------------
  OEChem TK	Core chemistry handling and representation as well as molecule file I/O
  OEDocking TK	Molecular docking and scoring
  Omega TK	Conformer generation
  Shape TK	3D shape description, optimization, and overlap
  Spicoli TK	Surface generation, manipulation, and interrogation
  Szmap TK	Understanding water interactions in a binding site
  Szybki TK	General purpose optimization with MMFF94
  Zap TK	Calculate Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic potentials
